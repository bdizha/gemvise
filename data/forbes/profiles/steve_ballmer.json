    "summary": "Steven Anthony Ballmer (; March 24, 1956) is an American businessman and investor who served as chief executive officer of Microsoft from 2000 to 2014. He is the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is a co-founder of Ballmer Group, a philanthropic investment company. \nAs of March 5, 2025, Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimated his personal wealth at around $136 billion, making him the tenth-richest person in the world, and the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List ranked him as the twelfth-richest person with a net worth of $117.8 billion.\nBallmer was hired by Bill Gates at Microsoft in 1980, and subsequently left the MBA program at Stanford University. He eventually became president in 1998, and replaced Gates as CEO on January 13, 2000. On February 4, 2014, Ballmer retired as CEO and was replaced by Satya Nadella; Ballmer remained on Microsoft's board of directors until August 19, 2014. Under Ballmer's leadership, a 14-year period, the company tripled sales and doubled profits, but lost its market dominance and missed out on 21st-century technology trends such as the ascendance of smartphones in the forms of iPhone and Android.\nPlayers and sportswriters generally consider Ballmer's ownership of the Clippers as an improvement over previous owner Donald Sterling, citing his willingness to acquire superstar players and finance the construction of Intuit Dome."

The river was known as le d\u00e9troit du Lac \u00c9ri\u00e9 in the French language, which means 'the strait of Lake Erie'. In the historical context, the strait included the St. Clair River, Lake St. Clair, and the Detroit River.\n\n\n=== Indigenous settlement ===\n\nPaleo-Indians inhabited areas near Detroit as early as 11,000 years ago including the culture referred to as the Mound Builders. By the 17th century, the region was inhabited by Huron, Odawa, Potawatomi, and Iroquois peoples. "

A three-year bachelor's degree usually does not qualify the holder for admission to graduate programs in other countries where four-year bachelor's degrees are the standard prerequisite.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nThe Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree is an undergraduate postsecondary degree that puts a focus on liberal arts and studies. In comparison, a Bachelor of Science (BS) has a greater focus on science, math, and engineering. The Bachelor of Arts degree is a type of baccalaureate degree. A Bachelor of Arts degree is usually completed in four years: that is, it requires four years of full-time coursework during term time. However, just as with other degrees, some may require a longer time period. This is due to factors such as the student's ability, motivation, and access to financial assistance to earn the degree. Just like other baccalaureate degrees, a Bachelor of Arts is historically offered only at public and private universities and colleges. A Bachelor of Arts, just like other bachelor's degrees, is an admission requirement for graduate and professional school. Beginning in the 1990s, junior colleges started to confer their own baccalaureate degrees. In addition to the standard BA degrees, there are career-specific Bachelor of Arts degrees, including Bachelor of Arts in Functional English, Bachelor of Arts in Administration, Bachelor of Arts in Interdisciplinary Studies, and Regents Bachelor of Arts.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Bachelor of Arts degree has been prominent in academics for centuries. It influenced universities to begin focusing on broad topics such as algebra, psychology, biology, art, history, and philosophy.\nThis aspect of the BA degree has been consistent in its history. The Bachelor of Arts degree was formed out of the study of liberal arts. Liberal art is a term that was applied to the study of many branches of learning such as grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. The study of liberal arts started during the Middle Ages. During the Renaissance, the term liberal art was meant to describe general studies more broadly. This definition of liberal studies remains to this day.\nIn Japan and the United States, Bachelor of Arts degrees were historically given only by public or private institutions and colleges.\n\n\n== Degrees in Europe ==\n\n\n=== Germany ===\nIn Germany, university-level education usually happens in either a Universit\u00e4t (plural: Universit\u00e4ten) or a Fach"

Modeled after the great Eastern universities, specifically Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, Stanford was often referred to as the \"Cornell of the West\" in its early years. This comparison was largely due to a significant portion of its faculty being former Cornell affiliates, including its first president, David Starr Jordan, and its second president, John Casper Branner. Both Cornell and Stanford were among the first to make higher education accessible, non-sectarian, and inclusive of women and men. Cornell is recognized as one of the first American universities to embrace this progressive approach to education, and Stanford quickly followed suit, solidifying its commitment to these ideals. \n\nFrom an architectural perspective, the Stanfords sought to distinguish their university by emulating the style of English university buildings while also incorporating elements of local California heritage. They specified in the founding grant that the buildings should \"be like the old adobe houses of the early Spanish days; they will be one-storied; they will have deep window seats and open fireplaces, and the roofs will be covered with the familiar dark red tiles.\" The Stanfords also hired renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, who previously designed the Cornell campus, to design the Stanford campus.\nWhen Leland Stanford died in 1893, the continued existence of the university was put in jeopardy due to a federal lawsuit against his estate, but Jane Stanford insisted the university remain in operation throughout the financial crisis. The university suffered major damage from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake; most of the damage was repaired, but a new library and gymnasium were demolished, and some original features of M"
