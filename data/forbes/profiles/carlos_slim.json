    "summary": "Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8ka\u027elos es\u02c8lin e\u02c8lu; - es\u02c8lim -]; born 28 January 1940) is a Mexican business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. From 2010 to 2013, Slim was ranked as the richest person in the world by Forbes business magazine. He derived his fortune from his extensive holdings in a considerable number of Mexican companies through his conglomerate, Grupo Carso. As of December 2024, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index ranked him as the 18th-richest person in the world, with a net worth of US$85 billion or about 4% of Mexico's GDP, making him the richest person in Latin America.\nSlim's corporate conglomerate spans numerous industries across the Mexican economy, including education, health care, industrial manufacturing, transportation, real estate, mass media, mining, energy, entertainment, technology, retail, sports and financial services. However, the core of his fortune derives from telecommunications, where he owns Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil (with operations throughout Latin America) and the Mexican carrier Telcel and ISP Telmex, a state-run-gone-private company which maintained a virtual monopoly for many years after Slim's acquisition. He accounts for 40% of the listings on the Mexican Stock Exchange. As of 2016, he was the largest single shareholder of non-voting shares of the New York Times Company.  In 2017, he sold half of his shares."
