    "summary": "Bernard Jean \u00c9tienne Arnault (French: [b\u025b\u0281na\u0281 \u0292\u0251\u0303 etj\u025bn a\u0281no]; born 5 March 1949) is a French businessman, investor and art collector. He is the founder, chairman and CEO of LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods company. Arnault is one of the richest individuals in the world; as of February 2025, he has an estimated net worth of US$186.8 billion according to Forbes and US$192 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. \nBorn in Roubaix, Arnault was raised in a devoutly Catholic household. He pursued Engineering at \u00c9cole polytechnique, graduating in 1971. He began his career in his father's company, Ferret-Savinel, shifting its focus to real estate, which laid the groundwork for his future career in the luxury goods market.\nArnault's entry into the luxury sector was marked by his strategic acquisition in 1984 of the financially-struggling textile and retail conglomerate Boussac Saint-Fr\u00e8res, which included the prestigious fashion house Christian Dior. His aggressive business strategies earned him the nickname \"The Terminator\", as he revitalized Dior and sold off other assets for profit. In 1987, he played a key role in the creation of LVMH (an acronym for Louis Vuitton Mo\u00ebt Hennessy), a global luxury goods company, by merging Louis Vuitton with Mo\u00ebt Hennessy. Through a series of strategic acquisitions and investments, Arnault built LVMH into a leading company in the luxury industry, overseeing significant growth and expansion into various sectors, including fashion, jewelry, watches, and wine.\nArnault's influence extends beyond LVMH, with investments in web companies and philanthropic endeavors, particularly in the arts. He has been involved in notable real estate and yacht ventures. His leadership has led to LVMH becoming the largest company by market capitalization in the eurozone. Despite controversies, including his attempt to become a Belgian citizen, Arnault's business acumen has solidified his status as a key figure in the global luxury market."
