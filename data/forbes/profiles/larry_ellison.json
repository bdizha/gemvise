Douglas. It closed in 1886 after years of financial struggle and a final annus horribilis in which the campus was badly damaged by fire and the school was foreclosed on by its creditors. Several years later, its trustees elected to change the school's name to the \"Old University of Chicago\" so that a new school could go by the name of the city.\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nIn 1890, the American Baptist Education Society incorporated a new University of Chicago as a coeducational:\u200a137\u200a institution, using $400,000 donated to the ABES to supplement a $600,000 donation from Standard Oil co-founder John D. Rockefeller, and land donated by Marshall Field. While the Rockefeller donation provided money for academic operations and long-term endowment, it was stipulated that such money could not be used for buildings. The Hyde Park campus\u2019 construction was financed by donations from wealthy Chicagoans such as Silas B. Cobb, who provided the funds for the campus's first building, Cobb Lecture Hall, and matched Marshall Field's pledge of $100,000. Other early benefactors included businessmen Charles L. Hutchinson (trustee, treasurer and donor of Hutchinson Commons), Martin A. Ryerson (president of the board of trustees and donor of the Ryerson Physical Laboratory) Adolphus Clay Bartlett and Leon Mandel, who funded the construction of the gymnasium and assembly hall, and George C. Walker of the Walker Museum, a relative of Cobb who encouraged his inaugural donation for facilities.\nThe new university acknowledged its predecessor.  The university's coat of arms has a phoenix rising from the ashes, a reference to the fire and foreclosure of the Old University of Chicago. A single stone from the rubble of th"

A businessperson undertakes activities (commercial or industrial) to generate cash flow, sales, and revenue by using a combination of human, financial, intellectual, and physical capital to fuel economic development and growth.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Medieval period: Rise of the merchant class ===\nMerchants emerged as a social class in medieval Italy. Between 1300 and 1500, modern accounting, the bill of exchange, and limited liability were invented, and thus, the world saw \"the first true bankers\", who were certainly businesspeople.\nAround the same time, Europe saw the \"emergence of rich merchants.\" This \"rise of the merchant class\" came as Europe \"needed a middleman\" for the first time, and these \"burghers\" or \"bourgeois\" were the people who played this role.\n\n\n=== Renaissance to Enlightenment: Rise of the capitalist ===\nEurope became the dominant global commercial power in the 16th century, and as Europeans developed new tools for business, new types of \"business people\" began to use those tools. In this period, Europe developed and used paper money, cheques, and joint-stock companies (and their shares of capital stock). Developments in actuarial science and underwriting led to insurance. Together, these new tools were used by a new kind of businessperson, the capitalist. These people owned or financed businesses as investors, but they were not merchants of goods. These capitalists were a major force in the Industrial Revolution.\nThe Oxford English Dictionary reports the earliest known use of the word \"business-men\" in 1798, and of \"business-man\" in 1803. By 1860, the spelling \"businessmen\" had emerged.\nMerriam Webster reports the earliest known use of the word \"businesswoman\" in 1827.\n\n\n=== Modern period: Rise of the business magnate ===\nThe newest kind of corporate executive working under a business magnate is the manager. One of the first true founders of the management profession was Robert Owen (1771\u20131858). He was also a business magnate in Scotland. He studied the \"problems of productivity and motivation\", and was followed by Frederick Winslow Taylor (1856\u20131915), who was the first person who studied work with the motive to train his staff in the field of management to make them efficient managers capable of managing his business. After World War I, management became popular due to the example of Herbert Hoover and the Harvard Business School, which offered degrees in business administration (management) with the motive to develop efficient managers so that business magnates could hire them with the goal to increase productivity of the private establishments business magnates own.\n\n\n== Salary ==\n\nSalaries for businesspeople vary. The salaries of businesspeople can be as high as billions of dollars per year. For example, the owner of Microsoft, Bill Gates makes $4 billion per year. The high salaries which businesspeople earn have often been a source of criticism from many who believe they are paid excessively.\n\n\n== Entrepreneurship ==\n\nAn entrepreneur is a person who sets up a business or multiple businesses (serial entrepreneur). Entrepreneurship may be defined as the creation or extraction of economic value. It is generally thought to embrace risks beyond what is normally encountered in starting a business. Its motivation can include other values than simply economic ones.\nIn general usage, because the distinction is not clear-cut, the term 'entrepreneur' may be used as a (self-)promoting euphemism for 'businessperson', or it may serve to objectively indicate particular passion and risk-taking in a business field. Still, the distinction is only one by degrees.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBusiness magnate\nBusiness\nEntrepreneur\nMedia proprietor\nCorporate\nSalaryman\nWhite-collar worker\nWomen in business\nAhaha\n\n\n== References =="

That is, someone who provides a business with capital and someone who buys a stock are both investors.  An investor who owns stock is a shareholder.\n\n\n== Types of investors ==\nThere are two types of investors: retail investors and institutional investors.\nA retail investor is also known as an individual investor.\nThere are several sub-types of institutional investor:\n\nPension plans making investments on behalf of employees\nBusinesses that make investments, either directly or via a captive fund\nEndowment funds used by universities, churches, etc.\nMutual funds, hedge funds, and other funds, ownership of which may or may not be publicly traded (these funds typically pool money raised from their owner-subscribers to invest in securities)\nSovereign wealth funds\nLarge money managers\nInvestors might also be classified according to their profiles. In this respect, an important distinctive investor psychology trait is risk attitude.\n\n\n== Investor protection through government ==\nInvestor protection through government involves regulations and enforcement by government agencies to ensure that market is fair and fraudulent activities are eliminated.  An example of a government agency that protects investors is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which works to protect reasonable investors in the United States.\nSimilar protections exist in other countries, including the United Kingdom where individual investors have certain protections via the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).\n\n\n== Investment tax structures ==\nCompany dividends are paid from net income, which has the tax already deducted. Therefore, shareholders are given some respite with a preferential tax rate of 15% on \"qualified dividends\" in the event of the company being domiciled in the United States. Alternatively, in another country having a double-taxation treaty with the US, accepted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Non-qualified dividends paid by other foreign companies or entities; for example, those receiving income derived from interest on bonds held by a mutual fund, are taxed at the regular and generally higher rate of income tax. When applied to 2013, this is on a sliding scale up to 39.6%, with an additional 3.8% surtax for high-income taxpayers ($200,000 for singles, $250,000 for married couples).\n\n\n== Role of the financier ==\n\nA financier () is a person whose primary occupation is either facilitating or directly providing investments to up-and-coming or established companies and businesses, typically involving large sums of money and usually involving private equity and venture capital, mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyouts, corporate finance, investment banking, or large-scale asset management. A financier makes money through this process when their investment is paid back with interest, from part of the company's equity awarded to them as specified by the business deal, or a financier can generate income through commission, performance, and management fees. A financier can also promote the success of a financed business by allowing the business to take advantage of the financier's reputation. The more experienced and capable the financier is, the more the financier will be able to contribute to the success of the financed entity, and the greater reward the financier will reap. The term, financier, is French, and derives from finance or payment.\nFinancier is someone who handles money. Certain financier avenues require degrees and li"

      "content": "An organizational founder is a person who has undertaken some or all of the formational work needed to create a new organization, whether it is a business, a charitable organization, a governing body, a school, a group of entertainers, or any other type of organization. If there are multiple founders, each can be referred to as a co-founder. If the organization is a business, the founder is usually an entrepreneur. If an organization is created to carry out charitable work, the founder is generally considered a philanthropist.\n\n\n== Issues arising from the role ==\nA number of specific issues have been identified in connection with the role of the founder. The founder of an organization might be so closely identified with that organization, or so heavily involved in its operations, that the organization can struggle to exist without the founder's presence. \"One practical way to cope with overreliance on a founder is to distribute management duties so that others are clearly responsible for important operations. If the founder is on the nonprofit's board, part of the solution is to make sure that the board is diverse, balanced, and regularly infused with new blood\".\n\n\n=== Legal status ===\nThe language of securities regulation in the United States considers co-founders to be \"promoters\" under Regulation D. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's definition of \"Promoter\" includes: (i) Any person who, acting alone or in conjunction with one or more other persons, directly or indirectly takes initiative in founding and organizing the business or enterprise of an issuer; however, not every promoter is a co-founder. In fact, there is no formal, legal definition of what makes someone a co-founder. The right to call oneself a co-founder can be established through an agreement with one's fellow co-founders or with permission of the board of directors, investors, or shareholders of a startup company. When there is no definitive agreement, like a shareholders' agreement, disputes about who the co-founders are, can arise.\n\n\n=== Founder emeritus ===\nSome organizations maintain a connection with their founder by establishing a position of founder emeritus, either as an entirely symbolic post, or as a position with some power, such as a permanent position on the board of directors. A drawback to such an arrangement is the possibility that the founder will clash with the person who has replaced them as leader of the organization, and that such a conflict will affect the performance of the founder emeritus as a board member.\n\n\n=== Founder's dilemma ===\nIn some instances, the desire of the founder to maintain control over the organization becomes a problem because, when an entrepreneurial organization is successful, \"[i]t outgrows the ability of the founder, or even of a small team around the founder, to control\". The Harvard Business Review identified this problem as the founder's dilemma, noting that in most successful companies, the founder is pushed out of control by investors within the first few years after the formation of the company. In some cases, a company may have multiple founders, and a prominent source of conflict can be disagreements between these founders as the company evolves. There are factors beyond the personality and professional accolades of a startup founder that impact the ability of a company to succeed, like trouble in funding, sudden market shutdown, not having the right team or poor scaling plan.\n\n\n=== Forgotten founder ===\nAnother problem that can arise is that of the forgotten founder, a person who participates early on in the formation of an enterprise, but leaves or is ousted before it achieves success, and then returns to claim a legal right to equity, intellectual property, or some other fruits of that success. To avoid this problem, it is advised that the entity \"incorporate early and issue shares that are subject to vesting over time\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nFounder's syndrome\nFounder CEO\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n"
