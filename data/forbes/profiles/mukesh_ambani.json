It is situated approximately 170 km (110 mi) east of the Bab-el-Mandeb strait.

Among the sayings of geographers about the city:\nYaqut al-Hamwi said: \"It is a famous city on the coast of the Indian Sea, towards the Yemen, and it is poor, with no water or pasture. They drink from a spring between it and Aden, about a distance of about today, and despite that, it is bad, except that this place is the port for Indian ships, and merchants gather there for that reason, as it is a town of trade.\" And it is added to Abyan, which is the opposite of Aden in its entirety.\nIbn Manzur said: \"It is a country on the edge of the sea in the furthest part of Yemen.\"\nIbn Khaldun said: \"This Aden is one of the most fortified cities in Yemen, and it is on the bank of the Indian Sea. It is still a country of trade from the time of the Trabaids, and most of them were built with stones, which is why silk merchants visit it often.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nAden is an ancient port and was mentioned by the Greeks under the name (Ancient Greek: \u0391\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1 \u0395\u03bc\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, romanized: Arabia Emporion), which means an Arabic trade port. The port's convenient position on the sea route between India and Europe has made Aden desirable to rulers who sought to possess it at various times throughout history. Known as Eudaemon (Ancient Greek: \u0395\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd, meaning \"blissful, prosperous\",) in the 1st century BC, it was a transshipping point for the Red Sea trade, but fell on hard times when new shipping practices by-passed it and made the daring direct crossing to India in the 1st century AD, according to the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.

It consisted of the port city of Aden and also included the outlying islands of Kamaran, Perim and the Khuria Muria archipelago with a total area of 192 km2 (74 sq mi). Initially a key port for the British East India Company, it was annexed by the British in 1839 to secure maritime routes and prevent piracy in the Arabian Sea. Its strategic position at the entrance to the Red Sea made it a vital stopover for ships traveling between Europe, India, and the Far East, especially after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. Aden quickly became a major coaling station and transit hub for British shipping, and its significance to the British Empire grew throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries.\nPrior to 1937, Aden had been governed as part of British India (originally as the Aden Settlement subordinate to the Bombay Presidency, and then as a Chief Commissioner's province). In 1 April 1937, Aden was separated from British India to become a Crown colony under the Government of India Act 1935, consisting of the city of Aden and its surrounding areas. The colony experienced rapid development due to its thriving port, but it was also marked by growing civil unrest. Economic inequality, labor strikes, and the rise of Arab nationalism contributed to increasing tensions, which were intensified by the anti-colonial sentiment in the Middle East. During this period, Aden became important for British military and commercial purposes in the region, as well as a base for the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. The colony's surrounding hinterland, was governed separately as the Aden Protectorate.\nBy the early 1960s, widespread dissatisfaction with British rule led to the Aden Emergency, a violent uprising against colonial authorities. In 1963, Aden Colony was reconstituted as the State of Aden within the newly created Federation of South Arabia in an attempt to grant limited self-governance, but the unrest continued. The British withdrew in 1967, and the colony was succeeded by the People's Republic of Southern Yemen, marking the end of British control after 128 years of rule.\n\n",

Their aims were to establish a supply port and stop attacks by Arab pirates against British shipping to India. The British Government thereafter considered Aden to be an important settlement due to its location, as the Royal Navy could easily access the port for resupply and repairs. Later, British influence extended progressively into the hinterland, both west and east, leading to the establishment of the Aden Protectorate.\n\nAden soon became an important transit port and coaling station for trade between British India and the Far East, and Europe. The commercial and strategic importance of Aden increased considerably when the Suez Canal opened in 1869. From then and until the 1960s, the Port of Aden was to be one of the busiest ship-bunkering, duty-free shopping, and trading ports in the world.\nIn 1937, Aden was separated from British India to become a Crown colony, a status that it retained until 1963. It consisted of the port city of Aden and its immediate surroundings (an area of 192 km2 [74 sq mi]). The Aden Settlement, and later Aden Colony, also included the outlying islands of Kamaran (de facto), Perim and Kuria Muria (see map).\nPrior to 1937, Aden had been governed as part of British India (originally as the Aden Settlement under the Bombay Presidency, and then as a Chief Commissioner's province). Under the Government of India Act 1935 the territory was detached from British India, and was re-organised as a separate Crown colony of the United Kingdom; this separation took effect on 1 April 1937.\nThrough the latter years of its existence, Aden Colony was plagued by civil unrest.\n\n\n=== Eliz"

Visvesvaraya Committee recommended an institution of the Faculty of Technology at University of Mumbai and a college of technology in Bombay. In 1930, Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi's motion in the Academic Council for the institution of a Department of Chemical Technology was accepted. In 1932, Schemes for two-year post-B.Sc. courses in Textile Chemistry and in Chemical Engineering leading to a B.Sc. (Tech) degree and the subsequent M.Sc. (Tech) and Ph.D. (Tech) degrees by research were approved.\nThe ICT was founded on 1 October 1933, as University Department of Chemical and Technology (UDCT) of the University of Mumbai by then vice chancellor Sir Vitthal N. Chandavarkar. Since he was also the Chairman of Mill Owners' Association, Chandavarkar was keen on catering to the needs of Mumbai's bustling textile industry. The institute offered admissions to 15 students in 2 two-year post-B.Sc. degree courses, B.Sc. (Tech) in Textile Chemistry and B.Sc. (Tech) in Chemical Engineering. These courses were started in the then Royal Institute of Science, Fort, Mumbai (now renamed as The Institute of Science, Mumbai), since the department's own building had not begun construction. Robert B. Forster of the University of Leeds became a Professor of Chemical Technology and the first Head of the Department on 26 October 1933. Krishnasami Venkataraman became the first Indian director of the institute on 8 November 1938. The first Ph.D. (Tech) and Ph.D. (Sci) degrees were awarded by the department in 1940 and 1941, respectively. The foundation stone for the department's own building was laid in Matunga, Mumbai on 17 March 1941.\n\n\n=== Expansion ===\nThe current campus in Matunga was occupied in June 1943. In 1944, other specializations:  Pharmaceuticals and Fine Chemicals; Chemistry of Food and Drugs; Technology of Intermediates and Dyes; Technology of Oils, Fats and Waxes; and Technology of Plastics, Paints and Varnishes were added to the B. Sc. (Tech) course. In 1948, B.Sc. (Tech) (Technology of Plastics) and B.Sc. (Tech.) (Technology of Paints, Pigments, and Varnishes) replaced the B.Sc. (Tech) (Technology of Plastics, Paints and Varnishes). In 1949, the B.Sc. (Tech) course in the Chemistry of Foods and Drugs re-designated as Technology of Foods. In 1951, the four-year Post-lnterscience course, B.Chem.Engg. course replaced the earlier B.Sc. (Tech) course in Chemical Engineering and the intake was increased from 15 to 20. In 1958, the number of seats for the B.Chem.Enng course were further increased to 60. The Departments of Chemistry and General Engineering were started in 1952. The first female student was awarded a Ph.D. (Tech) in 1957. A three-year Bachelors of Pharmacy (B.Pharm) course was launched in 1958, becoming the first course of its kind in the state of Maharashtra. In 1960, ICT celebrated its Silver Jubilee, and the occasion was graced by then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru. In 1984, a four-year B.Pharm course replaced the earlier three-year course. In 2001, four year B.Tech courses replaced all B.Sc. (Tech) courses.\n\n\n=== Autonomy ===\nThe university received partial autonomy from University of Mumbai in 1985 and was conferred the autonomous status on the UDCT in 1994, with concurren"
