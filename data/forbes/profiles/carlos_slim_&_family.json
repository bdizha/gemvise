    "summary": "Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa (Spanish pronunciation: [\u02c8ka\u027elos es\u02c8lin e\u02c8lu; - es\u02c8lim -]; born 28 January 1940) is a Mexican business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. From 2010 to 2013, Slim was ranked as the richest person in the world by Forbes business magazine. He derived his fortune from his extensive holdings in a considerable number of Mexican companies through his conglomerate, Grupo Carso. As of December 2024, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index ranked him as the 18th-richest person in the world, with a net worth of US$85 billion or about 4% of Mexico's GDP, making him the richest person in Latin America.\nSlim's corporate conglomerate spans numerous industries across the Mexican economy, including education, health care, industrial manufacturing, transportation, real estate, mass media, mining, energy, entertainment, technology, retail, sports and financial services. However, the core of his fortune derives from telecommunications, where he owns Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil (with operations throughout Latin America) and the Mexican carrier Telcel and ISP Telmex, a state-run-gone-private company which maintained a virtual monopoly for many years after Slim's acquisition. He accounts for 40% of the listings on the Mexican Stock Exchange. As of 2016, he was the largest single shareholder of non-voting shares of the New York Times Company.  In 2017, he sold half of his shares."

      "title": "Spanish naming customs",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_name",
      "summary": "Spanish names are the traditional way of identifying, and the official way of registering, a person in Spain. They are composed of a given name (simple or composite) and two surnames (the first surname of each parent). Traditionally, the first surname is the father's first surname, and the second is the mother's first surname. Since 1999, the order of the surnames in a family in Spain is decided when registering the first child, but the traditional order is nearly universally chosen (99.53% of the time).\n\nThe practice is to use one given name and the first surname generally (e.g. \"Pen\u00e9lope Cruz\" for Pen\u00e9lope Cruz S\u00e1nchez); the complete name is reserved for legal, formal and documentary matters. Both surnames are sometimes systematically used when the first surname is very common (e.g., Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, Pablo Ruiz Picasso or Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero) to get a more distinguishable name. In these cases, it is even common to use only the second surname, as in \"Lorca\", \"Picasso\" or \"Zapatero\". This does not affect alphabetization: \"Lorca\", the Spanish poet, must be alphabetized in an index under \"Garc\u00eda Lorca\", not \"Lorca\" or \"Garc\u00eda\".\nSpanish naming customs were extended to countries under Spanish rule, influencing naming customs of Hispanic America and Philippines to different extent.\n\n",

Traditionally, a person's first surname is the father's first surname (apellido paterno), while their second surname is the mother's first surname (apellido materno). For example, if a man named Eduardo Fern\u00e1ndez Garrido marries a woman named Mar\u00eda Dolores Mart\u00ednez Ruiz (note that women do not change their name with marriage) and they have a child named Jos\u00e9, there are several legal options, but their child would most usually be known as Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez.\nSpanish gender equality law has allowed surname transposition since 1999, subject to the condition that every sibling must bear the same surname order recorded in the Registro Civil (civil registry), but there have been legal exceptions. Since 2013, if the parents of a child were unable to agree on the order of surnames, an official would decide which is to come first, with the paternal name being the default option. The only requirement is that every son and daughter must have the same order of the surnames, so they cannot change it separately. Since June 2017, adopting the paternal name first is no longer the standard method, and parents are required to sign an agreement wherein the name order is expressed explicitly. The law also grants a person the option, upon reaching adulthood, of reversing the order of their surnames. However, this legislation only applies to Spanish citizens; people of other nationalities are issued the surname indicated by the laws of their original country.\nEach of these two surnames can also be composite in itself, with the parts usually linked by:\n\nthe conjunction y or e (and),\nthe preposition de (of), or\na hyphen.\nFor example, a person's name might be Juan Pablo Fern\u00e1ndez de Calder\u00f3n Garc\u00eda-Iglesias, consisting of a forename (Juan Pablo), a paternal surname (Fern\u00e1ndez de Calder\u00f3n), and a maternal surname (Garc\u00eda-Iglesias).\n\n\n=== Forms of address ===\n\nA man named Jos\u00e9 Antonio G\u00f3mez Iglesias would normally be addressed as either se\u00f1or G\u00f3mez or se\u00f1or G\u00f3mez Iglesias instead of se\u00f1or Iglesias, because G\u00f3mez is his first surname. Furthermore, Mr. G\u00f3mez might be informally addressed as\n\nJos\u00e9 Antonio\nJos\u00e9\nPepe (nickname for Jos\u00e9)\nAntonio\nTo\u00f1o (nickname for Antonio)\nJoselito, Josito, Joselillo, Josico or Josel\u00edn (diminutives of Jos\u00e9)\nAnto\u00f1ito, To\u00f1\u00edn, To\u00f1ito, \u00d1o\u00f1o or Nono (diminutive"

Greater Mexico City has a GDP of $411 billion in 2011, which makes it one of the most productive urban areas in the world.

But it was English politician Charles Latrobe who really penned the following: \"... look at their works: the moles, aqueducts, churches, roads\u2014and the luxurious City of Palaces which has risen from the clay-built ruins of Tenochtitlan...\", on page 84 of the Letter V of The Rambler in Mexico.\nDuring the colonial period, the city's motto was \"Muy Noble e Insigne, Muy Leal e Imperial\" (Very Noble and Distinguished, Very Loyal and Imperial). During Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador's administration a political slogan was introduced: la Ciudad de la Esperanza (lit.\u2009'The City of Hope'). This motto was quickly adopted as a city nickname but has faded since the new motto, Capital en Movimiento (\"Capital in Movement\"), was adopted by the administration headed by Marcelo Ebrard, though the latter is no"
