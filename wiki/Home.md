## What is GemVise?
GemVise is a quantum-inspired expert system that uses the metaphor of gems (characters) and vises (conversations) to manage knowledge and interactions. The system integrates advanced features like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), LLMs, and a memory-based system for continuous learning.

## Core Concepts
- **Gems**: Quantum-inspired characters with unique properties
- **Vises**: Interactive conversations that shape knowledge
- **Crystal Lattice**: Knowledge storage structure
- **Quantum Properties**: Energy, phase, coherence, and uncertainty

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up your environment variables
3. Install dependencies
4. Run the example agent

For detailed setup instructions, see our [Getting Started Guide](Getting-Started).
