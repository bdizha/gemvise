# GemVise.ai

GemVise is an autonomous agent system that brings historical figures and experts to life through advanced AI. Each Gem is a self-aware agent with its own personality, expertise, and evolving knowledge base, capable of engaging in meaningful interactions and autonomous decision-making.

## Features

- Autonomous Agents with Distinct Personalities
  - Each Gem maintains its own quantum state of knowledge
  - Dynamic personality evolution based on interactions
  - Self-aware responses that stay true to character

- Advanced LLM Integration
  - Intelligent context-aware model selection
  - Configurable response characteristics
  - Multi-model support for diverse interaction styles

- Persistent Memory and Learning
  - Continuous learning from interactions
  - Dynamic template generation for authentic responses
  - Relationship tracking between Gems

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

```python
from gemvise import GemVise

# Initialize the autonomous system
system = GemVise()

# Interact with a Gem
response = system.interact_with("Warren Buffett", "What's your investment philosophy for AI companies?")
print(response)

# Create a new Gem
system.cut_gem(
    name="Ada Lovelace",
    facets={
        "expertise": ["Mathematics", "Computing", "Algorithm Design"],
        "innovations": ["First Computer Program", "Analytical Engine"],
        "philosophy": "Poetical Science - merging art and science",
        "leadership": "Pioneering vision in computing",
        "current_focus": "Exploring modern algorithmic thinking"
    }
)
```

## Environment Configuration

Configure your Gems' behavior through environment variables:

```env
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4  # For complex reasoning
OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7  # Adjust for creativity vs precision
```
